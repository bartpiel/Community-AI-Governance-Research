## Research Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive, comparative study of **how open communities govern AI-generated contributions** across different domains and organizational structures.

### Research Question

### Projects Studied

1. **Wikipedia** ( Complete) - Community-driven content platform
2. **Open Source Foundations** ( Framework ready) - Apache, Linux, Eclipse, Mozilla
3. **Free Software Ecosystem** ( Framework ready) - FSF/GNU
4. **Open Source Initiative** ( Framework ready) - OSI ecosystem

- 0 AI policy citations in 10,000 edits (0.000%)
- 100+ deletion discussions about AI content
- 59% deletion rate for AI-generated articles
- Bottom-up governance through community norms

**Read More**: [`Wikipedia/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`](Wikipedia/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)

---

### Phase 2: Foundation Analysis (Framework Ready)

**Framework Complete**: Analysis tools ready for:
- Apache Software Foundation
- Eclipse Foundation

## Wikipedia Findings Summary

### Quantitative Results

```
Policy Analysis:
 Governance pages analyzed: 42
 Pages with AI content: 16 (38%)
 Total AI references: 581

WikiProject Analysis:
 Projects enumerated: 1,096+
 Projects analyzed: 50
 Projects with AI policies: 0 (0%)

Policy Citations (10,000 edits):
 Total citations: 1,820
 AI-specific: 0 (0.000%)
 Bot/automation: 311 (17.1%)

AfD Analysis (30 discussions):
 Total discussions found: 100+
 Deletion rate: 59%
 Keep rate: 11%
 GPTZero usage: 20%
```

### Qualitative Findings

**Governance Model**: Centralized policy + distributed enforcement + consensus-based decisions

**Detection Methods**:
- 80% human judgment ("reads like AI")
- 20% detection tools (GPTZero)
- Focus on secondary indicators (no sources, hallucinated references)

**Community Language**:
- Pejorative: "AI slop", "AI garbage", "word salad"
- Technical: "hallucination", "fabricated references"
- Generally negative attitude toward undisclosed AI use

**Deletion Arguments**:
1. Hallucinated references (fabricated citations)
2. Lack of sources (unverifiable)
3. Wasted cleanup effort ("not worth volunteer time")
4. Undisclosed AI use (deception)
5. Mass creation (systematic abuse)

**When Content Survives (11%)**:
- Notable subject (e.g., historical figures)
- Cleanup feasible
- Sources added
- Content valuable despite generation method

**Key Principle**: **Notability trumps method** - generation method matters less than quality

## Research Framework

### Comparative Dimensions

This study examines AI governance across multiple dimensions:

#### 1. **Domain Type**
- **Content** (Wikipedia) - Text, articles, encyclopedic entries
- **Code** (Foundations) - Software, repositories, contributions

#### 2. **Organizational Structure**
- **Community-driven** (Wikipedia) - No central foundation
- **Foundation-led** (Apache, Linux, etc.) - Organizational oversight
- **Movement-based** (FSF) - Ideological framework

#### 3. **Governance Model**
- **Centralized** - Top-down policy from foundation
- **Decentralized** - Project/community autonomy
- **Federated** - Mixed models

#### 4. **Philosophy**
- **Pragmatic** (Open Source) - Focus on quality, functionality
- **Ideological** (Free Software) - Focus on freedom, ethics
- **Neutral** (Wikipedia) - Focus on verifiability, neutrality

#### 5. **Detection Challenges**
- **Text detection** - Style, hallucinations, fabricated refs
- **Code detection** - Patterns, style, licensing issues

## Key Research Questions

### For Each Foundation/Ecosystem

1. **Policy Existence**
 - Do formal AI policies exist?
 - Are they cited in discussions?
 - How were they developed?

2. **Detection Methods**
 - How is AI code/content detected?
 - What tools are used?
 - Subjective vs. objective criteria?

3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**
 - What happens to AI-generated contributions?
 - Code review processes?
 - Contributor consequences?

4. **Community Attitudes**
 - What language is used?
 - Pejorative vs. neutral framing?
 - Distinction between AI-assisted vs. AI-generated?

5. **Philosophical Stance**
 - Does ideology matter (free software vs. open source)?
 - Quality vs. provenance?
 - Licensing implications?

### Cross-Domain Comparisons

1. **Content vs. Code**
 - Is code easier/harder to detect than text?
 - Different quality standards?
 - Different enforcement patterns?

2. **Community vs. Foundation**
 - Top-down vs. bottom-up governance?
 - Policy formalization timelines?
 - Enforcement consistency?

3. **Pragmatic vs. Ideological**
 - Do philosophical differences matter?
 - OSI vs. FSF approaches?
 - Impact on acceptance of AI?

## Preliminary Insights (From Wikipedia)

### What We've Learned

1. **Governance without policy is possible**
 - Wikipedia proves bottom-up norms can work
 - But: inconsistent, subjective, hard to scale

2. **Practice precedes policy**
 - Community develops norms first
 - Formalization follows (~2+ year lag)
 - May not need formalization if norms work

3. **Detection is the bottleneck**
 - Subjective judgment dominates (80%)
 - Tools underused (20%)
 - False positive/negative risks

4. **Trust matters more than quality**
 - Undisclosed AI use = serious violation
 - Hallucinated references = trust breach
 - Deception drives deletion more than quality

5. **Existing frameworks can adapt**
 - No need for AI-specific rules (yet)
 - Verifiability, sourcing, quality standards sufficient
 - New technology doesn't always need new rules

6. **Scale drives formalization**
 - Small scale → informal norms work
 - Large scale → may force policy creation
 - 2025 spike suggests tipping point approaching

### Questions for Foundations

- Will software foundations show similar patterns?
- Is code detection easier than text detection?
- Do foundations formalize faster than communities?
- Does ideology (FSF) produce different outcomes than pragmatism (Apache)?
