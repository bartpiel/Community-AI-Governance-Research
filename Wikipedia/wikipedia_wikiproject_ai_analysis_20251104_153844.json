Unfortunately, these models virtually always fail to properly source claims and often introduce errors. Essays like [[WP:LLM]] strongly encourage care in using them for editing articles. These are the project's goals:\n* To identify text written by AI, and proofread such text to make sure they follow Wikipedia's policies. Any unsourced or likely inaccurate claims should be removed.\n* To identify AI-generated images and ensure appropriate usage.\n* To help and keep track of AI-using editors who may not realize the deficiencies of AI as a writing tool.\n\nThe purpose of this project is <strong>not</strong> to restrict or ban the use of AI in articles, but to verify that its output is acceptable and constructive, and to fix or remove it otherwise.\n\n",

        "content": "* Tag articles with appropriate templates, remove unsourced information and warn users who add unsourced AI-generated content to articles.\n* Articles that are clearly entirely LLM-generated pages without human review can be nominated for [[WP:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]] under [[WP:G15]].\n* Identifying AI-assisted edits is difficult in most cases since the generated text is often indistinguishable from human text. The [[WP:AISIGNS|signs of AI writing]] page provides a list of characteristics that are associated with text generated by AI chatbots.\n** If the text contains phrases like \"as an AI model\" or \"as of my last knowledge update\", or if the editor copy-pasted the [[Prompt engineering|prompt]] used to generate the text together with the AI response, the text is almost certainly AI-generated.\n** Other indications include the presence of fake references or other obvious [[Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|AI hallucinations]]. AI content sometimes takes a promotional tone, reading like a tourism website. Other times, the AI gets confused and will [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Villa_Llao_Llao&oldid=1188096973 write about] [[Llao Llao Hotel|a hotel]] instead of [[Villa Llao Llao|a nearby village]].\n** [[AI content detection]] tools like [[GPTZero]] are unreliable and should not be used as the sole means of determining whether text is AI-generated. Given the high rate of false positives, deleting or tagging content purely because it was flagged by an automatic AI detector is not acceptable.\n* When missing more precise information, AI will often describe in detail very generic and common features, praising [[Rezaabad, Saveh|a village]] for its [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rezaabad,_Saveh&diff=prev&oldid=1187912265 fertile farmlands, livestock and scenic countryside] despite it being in an arid mountain range.\n* AI content is not always \"unsourced\"—sometimes it has real sources that are unrelated to the article's topic, sometimes it creates its own [[Wikipedia:Fictitious references|fake sources]], and sometimes it uses legitimate sources to create the AI content. Be careful when removing bad AI content not to remove legitimate sources, and always check the cited sources for legitimacy.\n** Example: the article [[Special:Permalink/1188376670|Leninist historiography]] was entirely written by AI and previously included a [https://web.archive.org/web/20230927000223/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninist_historiography list of completely fake sources] in Russian and Hungarian at the bottom of the page. Google turned up no results for these sources.\n** Other example: the article ''[[Estola albosignata]]'', about a beetle species, had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Estola_albosignata&diff=prev&oldid=1152503574 paragraphs written by AI] sourced to actual German and French sources. While the sourced articles were real, they were completely off-topic, with the French one discussing a completely unrelated lifeform.\n* Sometimes entire articles are AI-generated, and in such a case, make sure to check that the topic is legitimate and [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]]. Occasionally, [[WP:HOAX]]es have made it onto Wikipedia because AI tools can create fake citations that may appear legitimate. \n** Example: the article [[Wikipedia:List of hoaxes on Wikipedia/Amberlihisar|Amberlihisar]] was created in January 2023, passed [[Wikipedia:articles for creation|articles for creation]], and was not discovered to be entirely fictional until December 2023. It has since now been deleted.\n* Text that was present in an article before November 30, 2022 (the release date of [[ChatGPT]]) is very unlikely to be AI-generated.\n\n",

Specifically, this means expanding, categorizing, and cleaning up existing articles, as well as creating new ones.\n\nIf you plan to be active in editing articles relating to academic journals, please add your name and your interests to the [[#Participants|Participant list]] below. Concrete proposals and suggestions to improve the WikiProject and articles are discussed on the [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Academic Journals|talk page]], and any and all interested parties are encouraged to join up and participate.\n\n{{Box-footer|}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:60%\">\n{{Portal:Physics/box-header|Scope & Goals|Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals}}\n{{TOC left}}\nThe project was originally started to cover [[academic journal]]s, but the scope has naturally expanded to cover related areas not covered by other WikiProjects. We want to improve the quality of articles about academic journals and their related topics, encourage the use of {{tl|cite journal}} and other {{tl|cite}} templates, and create articles from the [[Wikipedia:List of missing journals|list of missing journals]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Academic_Journals/Journals_cited_by_Wikipedia/Missing1|list of highly cited [on Wikipedia] journals without articles]]).\n\nSpecifically, we cover academic journals and their publishers, academic societies and their bulletins [internal publications], academic conferences and their proceedings, academic awards prizes and medals, and series of monographs. We also cover (to a lesser extent) academic libraries, archives, and databases.\n{{Box-footer|}}\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:39%\">\n{{Portal:Physics/box-header|Suggestions|Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals}}\nWhen using an academic journal as a source and/or if you are starting an article on a journal, you should do the following:\n<!--\n* Check if it is on the [https://doaj.org/ Directory of Open Access Journals] if it's an open-access journal - Inclusion on the DOAJ is a sign of reliability - Its site states: \"[https://doaj.org/about A DOAJ Membership is a clear statement of intent and proves a commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access].\"\n-->\n* Check whether it is on the (discontinued) [https://web.archive.org/web/20170103170850/https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ Beall's List of Predatory Journals] (or its [https://beallslist.net/ mirror]) - if it's on the list, don't use it, please!\n{{Box-footer|}}\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:39%\">\n{{Portal:Physics/box-header|[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Article alerts|Article Alerts]]|Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Article alerts}}\n{{/Article alerts}}\n{{User:WolterBot/Cleanup listing subscription|hidden=1}}\n{{Box-footer|}}\n</div>\n{{User:WP 1.0 bot/Tables/Project/Academic Journal}}\n\n<div style=\"float:left; width:100%\">\n{{Portal:Physics/box-header|New articles|Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals}}\n[[Category:Wikipedia new articles|Academic journals]]<!-- please keep this category here until you decide to make it into a separate page, similar to many other ones -->\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Academic Journal articles by quality log}}\nPlease feel free to list your new articles on journals or journals-related topics here''' (newer articles at the top, please)'''.

'''WikiVault''' is a GenAI-assisted Wikipedia editing tool that has been deployed on the Korean Wikipedia since May 2025.\nIt was developted by Korean Wikipedian Ted Yoo, one of the project's participants, with the support from the Korean WikiMedia Association. \nThe tool currently provides two main functions:\n* Translation – translating English articles into Korean\n* Article drafting – generating initial article drafts from user prompts\n\nMore details about the tool's functionality can be found [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Korea/WikiVault|on this page]].\n\nSince its deployment, there have been active community discussions within the Korean Wikipedia about the use of WikiVault - ranging from policy considerations to values and concerns around AI-assisted editing. \nAcross many language editions of Wikipedia, communities are also exploring how to thoughtfully integrate GenAI tools into their workflows. \nThe Korean experience with WikiVault can provide a valuable opportunity to learn from a real-world deployment and contribute data-driven, community-centered insights to these broader conversations.\n\n",
