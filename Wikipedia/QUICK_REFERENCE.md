# Wikipedia AI Governance - Quick Reference Card

## Key Numbers at a Glance

### The "Invisible Policy" Finding

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Formal AI policy** | None (draft only) | No adopted policy exists |
| **AI policy citations** | 0 out of 10,000 edits | 0.000% citation rate |
| **AfD discussions** | 100+ found | Active enforcement |
| **Deletion rate** | 59% | Most AI content deleted |
| **WikiProjects with AI policies** | 0 out of 1,096+ | Fully centralized |

**→ Conclusion**: Bottom-up governance without formal policy

---

## Detection Methods

| Method | Usage | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Human judgment** | 80% | "Reads like AI", style-based |
| **GPTZero tool** | 20% | Explicit AI detection |
| **Pattern recognition** | Common | No sources + generic + hallucinated refs |

**Top indicators**: GPT (170 mentions), ChatGPT (155), AI-generated (67)

---

## Community Language

### What editors say:

**Pejorative** (negative attitude):
- "AI slop" (low-quality)
- "AI garbage/mess" (worthless)
- "word salad" (incoherent)

**Technical** (descriptive):
- "hallucination" (fabricated info)
- "hallucinated references" (fake citations)

**Neutral**:
- "AI-generated" (factual)

---

## Deletion Arguments

**Top 5 reasons for deleting AI content**:

1. **Hallucinated references** - Fabricated citations
2. **Lack of sources** - Unverifiable claims
3. ⏰ **Wasted effort** - Not worth cleanup time
4. **Undisclosed use** - Deception/dishonesty
5. **Mass creation** - Systematic abuse

**Key quote**:
> "Better to remove AI content due to their tendency to hallucinate... rather than waste volunteer time."

---

## When AI Content Survives (11%)

**Criteria for keeping**:
- Notable subject (e.g., historical figure)
- Cleanup feasible
- Sources added
- Content valuable

**Principle**: **Notability > Method**

---

## Policy Application

**Most cited in AI AfD discussions** (NO AI-specific policies):

| Policy | Count | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| WP:TNT | 8 | Beyond repair |
| WP:SIGCOV | 4 | Needs sources |
| WP:V | 3 | Verifiability |
| WP:OR | 2 | Original research |

**→ Existing policies adapted to AI cases**

---

## Temporal Trends

| Year | AI Edits | Trend |
|------|----------|-------|
| 2023 | 44 | Baseline |
| 2024 | 9 | Drop |
| 2025 | 63 | **Spike** |

**Editor quote**: "I've seen 5 AI AFDs in past month... Honestly kind of scary."

## Governance Model

```
Wikipedia AI Governance Architecture

Policy Level: CENTRALIZED
 Draft policy (not adopted)
 No AI shortcuts (WP:NOTAI )
 Uses existing policies (WP:V, WP:RS)

Enforcement Level: DISTRIBUTED
 1,096+ WikiProjects (0 with AI policies)
 WikiProject AI Cleanup (coordinator, not policy-maker)
 Individual editors detect AI
 AfD discussions decide fate

Decision Level: CONSENSUS
 ~2.8 voters per AfD
 59% deletion rate
 Quick consensus (no controversy)
```

## Research Implications

### For Wikipedia

1. **Bottom-up works** - Governance without formal policy
2. **Existing frameworks adapt** - No need for new rules
3. **Detection is bottleneck** - Subjective judgment
4. **Trust matters most** - Deception > quality issues
5. **Pragmatism wins** - Results > provenance

### For Software Projects (comparative questions)

1. **Detection**: Code easier/harder than text?
2. **Policy**: Formal AI policies exist?
3. **Philosophy**: Pragmatic vs. ideological?
4. **Enforcement**: What happens to AI PRs?
5. **Language**: Similar attitudes?

## Methodology Highlights

### What Worked 

- Targeted sampling (46% hit rate)
- Policy citation analysis (1,820 citations)
- AfD discussion analysis (30 deep dives)
- Mixed methods (quant + qual)

### What Failed 

- Random sampling (0% hit rate)
- Simple keyword search (false positives)

### Key Lesson

**Rare events need strategic sampling**, not random

## Key Takeaways

1. **No formal policy ≠ no governance**
 - Wikipedia proves bottom-up works

2. **Practice precedes policy**
 - Community norms emerge first
 - Formalization follows (2+ year lag)

3. **Detection is hard**
 - Mostly subjective judgment
 - Tools underused (20%)
 - False positive risk

4. **Hallucination drives deletion**
 - Fabricated citations = serious
 - Worse than no sources
 - Trust breach matters

5. **Pragmatic approach**
 - Notable subjects saved
 - Quality > provenance
 - ROI matters (volunteer time)

6. **Existing rules work**
 - No need for AI-specific policies (yet)
 - WP:V, WP:RS, WP:OR sufficient
 - Adaptation > innovation

7. **Scale is increasing**
 - 2025 spike (63 edits)
 - Editor concern growing
 - May force policy formalization

8. **Centralized + distributed**
 - Policy: centralized (no WikiProject autonomy)
 - Enforcement: distributed (community detection)
 - Decision: consensus (AfD discussions)
