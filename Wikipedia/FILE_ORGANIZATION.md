## Reading Guide

### For Quick Overview (15 minutes)
1. Read `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (sections 1-5)
2. Skim key statistics

### For Deep Understanding (2-3 hours)
1. Start with `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
2. Read `Wikipedia_AfD_AI_Detection_Analysis.md` (real-world enforcement)
3. Read `Wikipedia_WikiProject_AI_Policy_Analysis.md` (governance structure)
4. Read `Wikipedia_AI_Policy_Citation_Analysis_2025.md` (quantitative data)

### For Methodology (1 hour)
1. `AI_Enforcement_Preliminary_Analysis.md` (what didn't work)
2. `AI_Enforcement_Targeted_Analysis.md` (what worked)
3. Review Python scripts for implementation details

### For Replication
1. All Python scripts are self-contained
2. Use Wikipedia Action API (free, no authentication)
3. Respect rate limits (0.5-1s delays between requests)
4. Expected runtime: 3-10 minutes per script

- `ai_enforcement_targeted_articles_20251104_174005.csv` - 13 articles analyzed

**Summary Data**:
- `wikipedia_ai_governance_pages_20251030_183154.csv` - 42 governance pages
- `wikipedia_wikiproject_ai_summary_20251104_153844.csv` - WikiProject summary

### Older/Superseded Files

These files are from preliminary analysis (kept for reproducibility):
- `ai_edit_enforcement_20251104_173519.csv` - Random sampling (0 hits)
- `ai_talk_discussions_20251104_173519.csv` - Random sampling (false positives)
- `ai_enforcement_articles_20251104_173519.csv` - Random sample articles

**Note**: Random sampling failed; targeted approach succeeded.

## Analysis Timeline

### Phase 1: Policy Analysis (Oct 30)
- Analyzed 42 governance pages
- Found 581 AI references
- Output: `Complete_Wikipedia_AI_Governance_Analysis.md`

### Phase 2: WikiProject Analysis (Nov 4, morning)
- Enumerated 1,096+ WikiProjects
- Analyzed top 50 for AI policies
- **Finding**: 0 WikiProjects have separate AI policies
- Output: `Wikipedia_WikiProject_AI_Policy_Analysis.md`

### Phase 3: Enforcement Analysis (Nov 4, afternoon)
- **Attempt 1**: Random sampling of 30 articles → 0% hit rate
- **Attempt 2**: Targeted sampling from WikiProject AI Cleanup → 46% hit rate
- Found 116 AI-related edits
- Output: `AI_Enforcement_Targeted_Analysis.md`

### Phase 4: Policy Citation Analysis (Nov 4, afternoon)
- Analyzed 10,000 recent edits
- Found 1,820 policy citations
- **Finding**: 0 AI policy citations (0.000%)
- Output: `Wikipedia_AI_Policy_Citation_Analysis_2025.md`

### Phase 5: Discussion Analysis (Nov 4, evening)
- Searched 118 discussion spaces
- Found 100+ AfD discussions
- Analyzed 30 in depth
- **Finding**: 59% deletion rate, GPTZero used in 20%
- Output: `Wikipedia_AfD_AI_Detection_Analysis.md`

### Phase 6: Synthesis (Nov 4, evening)
- Created `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- Organized repository
- Ready for publication

## Key Findings Summary

### Quantitative Results

```
Policy Analysis:
 Governance pages analyzed: 42
 Pages with AI content: 16 (38%)
 Total AI references: 581

WikiProject Analysis:
 Projects enumerated: 1,096+
 Projects analyzed: 50
 Projects with AI policies: 0 (0%)

Enforcement Analysis:
 Random sample hit rate: 0%
 Targeted sample hit rate: 46%
 AI-related edits found: 116

Policy Citations (10,000 edits):
 Total citations: 1,820
 AI-specific: 0 (0.000%)
 Bot/automation: 311 (17.1%)

AfD Analysis (30 discussions):
 Total discussions found: 100+
 Deletion rate: 59%
 Keep rate: 11%
 GPTZero usage: 20%
```

### Qualitative Findings

**Detection Methods**:
- 80% human judgment ("reads like AI")
- 20% detection tools (GPTZero)
- Focus on secondary indicators (no sources, hallucinated refs)

**Community Language**:
- Pejorative: "AI slop", "AI garbage"
- Technical: "hallucination", "fabricated references"
- Generally negative attitude

**Deletion Arguments**:
1. Hallucinated references
2. Lack of sources
3. Wasted cleanup effort
4. Undisclosed AI use
5. Mass creation

**Governance Model**:
- Bottom-up (emergent norms)
- Distributed enforcement (AfD discussions)
- Centralized policy (no WikiProject autonomy)
- Pragmatic (notability trumps method)

## Methodology Notes

### What Worked

 **Targeted sampling** (from WikiProject AI Cleanup)
 **Policy citation analysis** (quantitative measure)
 **AfD discussion analysis** (real-world enforcement)
 **API-based data collection** (reproducible)
 **Mixed methods** (quant + qual)

### What Didn't Work

 **Random sampling** (0% hit rate for rare events)
 **Simple keyword search** ("AI" too generic, many false positives)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Rare events need targeted sampling**, not random
2. **Context matters**: "AI" in "AI Cleanup" vs. "AI-generated content"
3. **Follow the enforcement trail**: AfD discussions more informative than edit summaries
4. **Policy lag**: Practice precedes formal policy by 2+ years
5. **Bottom-up governance**: Effective without top-down rules (but has limits)

## Future Directions

### For Wikipedia Research

- [ ] Monitor draft policy adoption process
- [ ] Track detection tool usage over time
- [ ] Analyze false positive/negative rates
- [ ] Study successful cleanup cases
- [ ] Long-term trend analysis (2026+)

### For Comparative Study

- [ ] Apache Foundation AI governance
- [ ] FSF/GNU philosophical stance
- [ ] Compare software vs. content governance
- [ ] Open-source vs. free-software approaches
- [ ] Cross-domain governance patterns
