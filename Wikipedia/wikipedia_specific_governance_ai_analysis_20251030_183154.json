Thus, if a name is widely used in reliable sources (particularly those written in English) and is therefore likely to be well recognized by readers, it may be used even though some could regard it as biased. For example, the widely used names \"[[Boston Massacre]]\", \"[[Teapot Dome scandal]]\", and \"[[Jack the Ripper]]\" are legitimate ways of referring to the subjects in question despite appearing to pass judgment. The best name to use for a topic may depend on the context in which it is mentioned.

Sometimes that common name includes non-neutral words that Wikipedia normally avoids (e.g. [[Alexander the Great]], or the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]). In such cases, the prevalence of the name, or the fact that a given description has effectively become a proper name (and that proper name has become the common name), generally overrides concern that Wikipedia might appear as endorsing one side of an issue.

This practice of using specialized names is often controversial, and should not be adopted unless it produces clear benefits outweighing the use of common names.

The VisualEditor can't parse references (and more broadly HTML tags) that are inside templates. This is apparently a design choice, it has been like this for around 10 years and isn't going to change. It means that in the VisualEditor, list-defined references that are within a reflist template can't be modified, and are not displayed (you instead get the message \"This reference is defined in a template or other generated block, and for now can only be previewed in source mode\"). However, the parsing works with list-defined references that use the <code><nowiki><references></nowiki></code> template.\n\nThere was [[Wikipedia talk:Citing sources/Archi",

Such pages are identified by a [[WP:NS|namespace]] prefix. For example, this page, ''Wikipedia:Be bold'', has the \"Wikipedia:\" prefix; if it were called simply ''Be bold'' (with no prefix) it would be an article. \n\nProblems may arise for a variety of reasons in different contexts in non-article namespaces.

That is different from assuming they have {{em|actually}} complied with either. Editors have a proactive obligation to document image uploads, etc. and material may be deleted if the documentation is incorrect or inadequate. Good-faith corrective action includes informing editors of problems and helping them improve their practices.\n",
