# Wikipedia AI Governance Research - Executive Summary

**Research Period**: October 30 - November 4, 2025
**Research Question**: How does Wikipedia govern AI-generated content in the absence of formal AI-specific policies?

---

## 🎯 Main Findings

### **1. The "Invisible Policy" Paradox**

Wikipedia has **NO formal AI policy** yet maintains **active AI governance**:

- ❌ No adopted AI policy (Wikipedia:AI-generated content is still a **draft proposal**)
- ❌ No AI policy shortcuts exist (WP:NOTAI doesn't exist)
- ❌ **0 AI policy citations** found in 10,000 recent edits (0.000%)
- ✅ **100+ active deletion discussions** about AI-generated articles
- ✅ **59% deletion rate** for AI-generated content
- ✅ **Bottom-up governance** through community practice

**Conclusion**: AI governance happens through **emergent community norms**, not top-down policy.

---

### **2. Detection Methods**

**How editors identify AI-generated content:**

| Method | Usage | Reliability |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Human judgment** | 80% | "Reads like AI", style-based |
| **GPTZero tool** | 20% | Explicit detection tool |
| **Pattern recognition** | Common | Hallucinated refs, no sources, generic text |
| **User history** | Occasional | "Communicates only via AI texts" |

**Top Detection Indicators** (in 30 AfD discussions):
- GPT: 170 mentions
- ChatGPT: 155 mentions
- AI-generated: 67 mentions
- Language model: 35 mentions
- Hallucination: 3 mentions

---

### **3. Community Language**

Editors developed informal vocabulary:

**Pejorative Terms**:
- "AI slop" (2 mentions) - Low-quality content
- "AI garbage/mess" - Worthless content
- "Word salad" (1 mention) - Incoherent text

**Technical Terms**:
- "Hallucination" (3 mentions) - Fabricated information
- "Hallucinated references" - Fake citations

**Key Insight**: Language reveals negative attitude toward AI-generated content, with emphasis on **deception** (undisclosed AI use) and **wasted effort** (cleanup time).

---

### **4. Enforcement Mechanisms**

**Where AI governance happens:**

1. **Articles for Deletion (AfD)**: 100+ discussions
   - 59% deletion rate
   - Consensus-based decisions
   - 2.8 average voters per discussion

2. **WikiProject AI Cleanup**: 207 watchers
   - Monitors AI-topic articles
   - Coordinates detection efforts
   - No separate AI policies (uses Wikipedia-wide rules)

3. **Village Pump (Policy)**: 50+ discussions
   - Policy proposals debated
   - Draft AI policy under development

4. **User blocks**: Systematic AI article creation → blocking
   - "Disrupting Wikipedia by creating AI-generated articles with hallucinated content"

---

### **5. Deletion Arguments**

**Most common reasons for deleting AI-generated articles:**

1. **Hallucinated references** (fabricated citations)
2. **Lack of sources** (unverifiable claims)
3. **Wasted cleanup effort** ("not worth volunteer time")
4. **Undisclosed AI use** (deception)
5. **Mass creation** (systematic abuse)

**Key Argument**:
> "It is better to remove AI generated content... due to their tendency to hallucinate information and references, rather than waste volunteer time trying to clean them up."

---

### **6. When AI Content Survives**

**3 cases (11%) resulted in "Keep" decisions:**

**Criteria for keeping AI-generated content:**
- ✅ **Notable subject** (e.g., historical figure mentioned by Herodotus)
- ✅ **Cleanup feasible** (problems can be fixed)
- ✅ **Sources added** (verifiability established)
- ✅ **Content valuable** (despite generation method)

**Key Principle**: **Notability trumps method** - generation method matters less than content quality.

---

### **7. Policy Application**

**Most cited policies in AI AfD discussions:**

| Policy | Citations | Meaning | AI Relevance |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| WP:TNT | 8 | Total Nuke & Rewrite | Article beyond repair |
| WP:SIGCOV | 4 | Significant Coverage | Lacks sources |
| WP:V | 3 | Verifiability | Can't verify claims |
| WP:OR | 2 | No Original Research | Unsourced assertions |

**Critical Finding**: **NO AI-specific policies cited** - existing content quality policies applied to AI cases.

---

### **8. Temporal Trends**

**AI content is increasing:**

- **2023**: 44 AI-related edits
- **2024**: 9 AI-related edits
- **2025**: 63 AI-related edits (to Nov 4)

**Editor observation**:
> "I've seen 5 AI-generated article AFDs in the past month alone. Prior to that, I had not seen one. Honestly kind of scary if you ask me."

**Implication**: Growing scale may force formal policy adoption.

---

### **9. Centralized vs. Decentralized Governance**

**WikiProject Analysis** (1,096+ projects examined):

- ❌ **0 WikiProjects** have separate AI policies
- ✅ All use **centralized Wikipedia policies**
- ✅ WikiProject AI Cleanup acts as **coordinating hub**, not autonomous policy-maker

**Governance Model**: **Centralized policy + distributed enforcement**

---

### **10. Policy vs. Practice Gap**

**Comparison of formal vs. actual governance:**

| Aspect | Formal Policy | Actual Practice |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **AI policy exists** | No (draft only) | Yes (informal norms) |
| **Policy citations** | 0 in 10,000 edits | Uses WP:V, WP:RS instead |
| **Detection tools** | Not specified | GPTZero (20% usage) |
| **Deletion mechanism** | Not defined | AfD discussions |
| **Deletion rate** | N/A | 59% |
| **User consequences** | Not defined | Blocking for mass creation |

## 🔑 Research Implications

### **1. Bottom-Up Governance Model**

Wikipedia demonstrates that **effective AI governance can emerge without formal policy**:

- ✅ Community develops detection practices
- ✅ Norms emerge through deletion discussions
- ✅ Existing policies adapted to new challenges
- ✅ Distributed enforcement works

**Challenge**: Inconsistent standards, subjective detection

---

### **2. Detection Challenges**

**Current state of AI detection:**

- Most detection is **subjective** ("reads like AI")
- Only 20% use **formal tools** (GPTZero)
- Detection based on **secondary indicators** (no sources, generic content)
- **False positive risk** (no systematic validation)

**Need**: Better detection tools, clearer criteria

---

### **3. Hallucination as Critical Issue**

**Fabricated citations are treated as serious violations:**

- Worse than no sources (creates false information)
- Primary argument for deletion
- May warrant user blocking

**Insight**: AI's hallucination problem drives governance responses

---

### **4. Efficiency Argument**

**Community prioritizes volunteer time:**

- "Not worth cleaning up" is valid deletion argument
- Even salvageable content may be deleted if cleanup is expensive
- Threshold question: Is subject notable enough to justify effort?

**Principle**: **Return on investment** matters in volunteer-driven governance

---

### **5. Formal Policy Lag**

**Timeline of AI governance development:**

- **2023**: AI content starts appearing
- **2023-2024**: Community develops informal norms
- **2024-2025**: Increased AI article creation
- **2025**: Draft policy still under development
- **Future**: Formal policy adoption?

**Pattern**: **Practice precedes policy** by 2+ years

---

## 🎓 Comparative Framework

### **For Comparing with Software Projects (Apache, FSF):**

**Questions to investigate:**

1. **Detection**:
   - Is AI-generated code easier/harder to detect than text?
   - What tools exist for code detection?
   - Pattern recognition in commits?

2. **Policy**:
   - Do software projects have formal AI policies?
   - Are policies cited in discussions?
   - Top-down vs. bottom-up governance?

3. **Philosophy**:
   - Open-source (pragmatic) vs. free-software (ideological)?
   - Does generation method matter or only quality?
   - Licensing implications?

4. **Enforcement**:
   - What happens to AI-generated PRs?
   - Code review processes?
   - Contributor consequences?

5. **Language**:
   - Similar vocabulary ("AI slop")?
   - Attitude toward AI assistance?
   - Distinction between AI-assisted vs. AI-generated?

## 💡 Key Insights

### **1. Governance Without Policy Works (But Has Limits)**

Wikipedia shows that **informal community norms can effectively govern AI content**, but:
- Inconsistent standards
- Subjective detection
- Difficult to scale
- Eventually needs formalization

---

### **2. Existing Frameworks Adapt**

Rather than creating new AI-specific policies, Wikipedia **applies existing policies**:
- WP:V (Verifiability) → AI content often unverifiable
- WP:RS (Reliable Sources) → AI fabricates citations
- WP:OR (Original Research) → AI generates unsourced claims

**Lesson**: New technology doesn't always need new rules.

---

### **3. Detection is the Bottleneck**

**Biggest challenge**: Reliably identifying AI-generated content
- Human judgment is subjective
- Detection tools (GPTZero) only used in 20% of cases
- Risk of false positives/negatives

**Implication**: Governance effectiveness limited by detection capability

---

### **4. Community Trust Matters**

**Key concerns driving deletion**:
- Undisclosed AI use (deception)
- Hallucinated references (false information)
- Mass creation (systematic abuse)

**Pattern**: Breach of trust more important than technical quality issues

---

### **5. Pragmatism Wins**

Despite concerns about AI, Wikipedia keeps AI-generated content when:
- Subject is notable
- Sources are added
- Content is valuable
- Cleanup is feasible

**Philosophy**: **Results matter more than provenance** (if quality standards are met)

---

## 🚀 Future Research Directions

### **For Wikipedia**:
1. Monitor formal policy adoption process
2. Track detection accuracy (false positives/negatives)
3. Study successful cleanup cases
4. Analyze temporal trends (is AI content increasing?)

### **For Software Projects**:
1. Apache Foundation AI governance analysis
2. FSF/GNU philosophical stance on AI
3. Compare open-source vs. free-software approaches
4. Code vs. content governance differences

### **Cross-Domain**:
1. Community-driven vs. foundation-driven governance
2. Content vs. code detection challenges
3. Legal/licensing implications
4. Philosophical differences (pragmatic vs. ideological)
